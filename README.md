# HealingHand

Developed by Anjalee Gitthens, Dillon Hughes, Godwin Igbekoyi, Kemma Kolstrup, and Erica Nichols for the University of Nevada, Reno's 2025 College of Engineering capstone course.

HealingHand is a self-contained, compact, wearable, at-home physical therapy device which targets finger mobility and grip strength. Millions suffer from conditions like osteoarthritis and stroke which can cause loss of mobility in the hands and fingers. One way to combat this loss of ability is physical therapy, which can be expensive and difficult to maintain. We created HealingHand to make physical therapy easier, more fun, and more accessible.

The device incorporates 4 flex and 4 force sensors to measure the user's grip strength and finger mobility. The user can choose between two therapy modes; game and exercise. The game is controlled using specific finger movements that resemble physical therapy exercises. The exercise mode leads the user through these exercises with specific instructions and feedback. 

The program's history is reflected in the various commits in this repository. Our greatest challenge was creating a functioning game, which we based off the open-source arduino_breakout.ino. From there we developed various menus for device navigation in HealingHandv1.ino. Then we developed rehab mode in HealingHandv2.ino and HealingHandv2_2.ino. Finally, we separated our 1400 lines of code into different files for readability and updated menu aethestics for consistency in HealingHandv1.1
